Chromatin profiles (DNASE-seq and ATAC-seq) exhibit multi-resolution shapes and spans regulated by co-operative binding of transcription factors (TFs). This complexity is further difficult to mine because of confounding bias from enzymes (DNASE-I/Tn5) used in these assays. Existing methods do not account for this complexity at base-resolution and do not account for enzyme bias correctly, thus missing the high-resolution architecture of these profiles. Here we introduce ChromBPNet to address both these aspects.

ChromBPNet (shown in the image as `Bias-Factorized ChromBPNet`) is a fully convolutional neural network that uses dilated convolutions with residual connections to enable large receptive fields with efficient parameterization. It also performs automatic assay bias correction in two steps, first by learning simple model on chromatin background that captures the enzyme effect (called `Frozen Bias Model` in the image). Then we use this model to regress out the effect of the enzyme from the ATAC-seq/DNASE-seq profiles. This two step process ensures that the sequence component of the ChromBPNet model (called `TF Model`) does not learn enzymatic bias.

## Installation

ChromBPNet needs Python >= 3.12 and, for training and interpretation, an NVIDIA GPU. It also runs on the CPU,
including on Apple-silicon Macs, which is fine for testing and small jobs. TensorFlow is not needed. Pick one of
the three ways below.

### 1. pixi (recommended)

[pixi](https://pixi.sh) installs both the Python packages and the command-line tools the pipeline calls
(bedtools, bedGraphToBigWig, samtools, MEME `tomtom`, pango for the PDF reports), all from the committed lock
file:

```
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
git clone https://github.com/NNFC-GMD/chrombpnet.git
cd chrombpnet
pixi install -e cuda13                    # Linux, NVIDIA driver >= 580
pixi run -e cuda13 gpu-check              # lists the GPU(s) JAX sees
pixi run -e cuda13 chrombpnet pipeline ...
pixi shell -e cuda13                      # or activate the environment and call `chrombpnet` directly
```

| environment | use it for |
|---|---|
| `cuda13` | Linux x86_64 / aarch64 with driver >= 580: H100, B200, RTX PRO 6000 and other Blackwell GPUs |
| `cuda12` | Linux x86_64 with an older driver (>= 525; Blackwell GPUs need >= 570) |
| `default` | CPU only: Linux and macOS arm64 (`pixi install`, `pixi run chrombpnet ...`) |
| `dev`, `cuda13-dev` | the same plus pytest and ruff: `pixi run -e dev test`, `pixi run -e cuda13-dev test-gpu` |

To install a GPU environment on a machine without a GPU (a login node, a CI runner, a container build), prefix
the command with `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA=13.0` (or `12.0`). MEME is only packaged for Linux, so on macOS use
`--tomtom-lite` (see below).

### 2. uv or pip (no conda)

```
git clone https://github.com/NNFC-GMD/chrombpnet.git
cd chrombpnet
uv sync --extra cuda13                    # --extra cuda12 for older drivers, no extra for CPU
uv run chrombpnet --help
# or into an existing virtual environment (Python >= 3.12):
uv pip install -e '.[cuda13]'
```

Do not `pip install chrombpnet` from PyPI: that installs upstream's TensorFlow-based 1.x release. Without conda
you have to provide these yourself:

- **bedtools** and **bedGraphToBigWig** (UCSC). `chrombpnet pipeline` and `chrombpnet bias pipeline` need them to
  turn BAM/fragment/tagAlign files into a bigWig, and `chrombpnet prep nonpeaks` needs bedtools.
- **MEME `tomtom`** for motif matching in the reports. Alternatively pass `--tomtom-lite` to use the bundled
  TOMTOM-lite. It is faster and needs no MEME, but reports p-values instead of q-values.
- **pango** for the PDF reports (weasyprint), e.g. `apt install libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0` or
  `brew install pango`.
- **pyBigWig** has PyPI wheels only for Linux x86_64. Elsewhere it builds from source, which needs a C compiler
  and zlib headers.

### 3. Docker or Apptainer

```
docker run --rm --gpus all ghcr.io/nnfc-gmd/chrombpnet:latest-cuda13 chrombpnet --help
apptainer exec --nv --cleanenv docker://ghcr.io/nnfc-gmd/chrombpnet:latest-cuda13 chrombpnet --help
docker build -t chrombpnet:cuda13 .       # build it yourself; see the Dockerfile header for cuda12 / CPU images
```

The image contains no CUDA toolkit. The host provides only the driver, through the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
(`--gpus`) or `apptainer --nv`. Images are pushed to ghcr.io for release tags. If there is none for your
version yet, build locally.

Apptainer passes the host environment into the container and binds `$HOME`. The image already ignores the
host's `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME` and `~/.local` Python packages. `--cleanenv` also keeps out every other host
variable, including ones you may want. Pass those explicitly, for example
`--env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="$CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"` when a scheduler has picked your GPUs, or
`--env XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.25`.

## GPU notes

- **Driver.** CUDA 13 needs NVIDIA driver >= 580 (the `nvidia-smi` header shows `CUDA Version: 13.x`). H100
  (sm_90), B200 (sm_100) and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm_120) are supported natively. With an older driver use the
  `cuda12` environment.
- **No `module load cuda`, no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.** JAX brings its own CUDA, cuDNN and NCCL as pip wheels.
  System CUDA libraries found first through `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` shadow them and break start-up.
- **Memory.** Importing chrombpnet sets `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false` when it is unset (the Docker image
  sets it too, and `gpu-check` imports chrombpnet first). JAX then allocates GPU memory as it needs it, instead of
  reserving 75% of the card at start-up. An `export XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=true` of your own wins.
- **Shared GPUs.** JAX does not return memory it has allocated until the process ends. DeepSHAP picks its batch
  size from the model size and the free GPU memory, so `chrombpnet pipeline` keeps that memory through the
  TF-MoDISco step that follows. On a GPU shared with other jobs, cap the process, e.g.
  `export XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.25`. The value is a fraction of the card's total memory.
- **Backend.** Importing chrombpnet also sets `KERAS_BACKEND=jax`. If your own code imports `keras` before
  chrombpnet, set `KERAS_BACKEND=jax` in the environment yourself.
- **Clusters.** [`workflows/slurm/`](workflows/slurm/) has a SLURM template for H100/B200 clusters, and
  [`workflows/molab/`](workflows/molab/) has scripts for molab GPU sessions.

## Optional flags

These are new in 2.x. The defaults reproduce the 1.x behaviour. `chrombpnet <command> --help` shows which
commands take which flag.

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| `--optimizer {adam,muon}` | `muon` applies Muon to the dilated convolution kernels and Adam to everything else (experimental) |
| `--muon-lr` | Muon learning rate (default 2e-3) |
| `--ema` | train with an exponential moving average of the weights (momentum 0.999), and evaluate and save the averaged weights |
| `--lr-schedule {constant,cosine}` | learning-rate schedule (default `constant`) |
| `--precision {default,highest,bf16}` | float32 matmul/convolution precision for training: `default` lets the GPU use TF32 as TensorFlow did, `highest` forces full float32, `bf16` trains in mixed bfloat16 |
| `--device {auto,gpu,cpu}` | `gpu` fails immediately if JAX sees no GPU, instead of silently training on the CPU |
| `--interpret-subsample N` | number of peaks used for DeepSHAP and TF-MoDISco in the pipelines (default 30000) |
| `--shap-seed`, `--shap-batch-seqs`, `--shap-precision` | DeepSHAP reference seed (default 1234), sequences per batch (default: automatic), precision (default `auto`: full float32 on CPU, TF32 on GPU as in 1.x) |
| `--modisco-max-seqlets`, `--modisco-window` | TF-MoDISco limits (defaults 50000 and 500) |
| `--tomtom-lite` | match motifs with TOMTOM-lite instead of MEME `tomtom`: much faster, needs no MEME, reports p-values |

## Compatibility with chrombpnet 1.x

- **Old models load directly.** TensorFlow 2.x `.h5` files from chrombpnet 1.x load as they are: `bias.h5`,
  `bias_model_scaled.h5`, `chrombpnet.h5` and `chrombpnet_nobias.h5`, including the
  [pre-trained bias models](https://zenodo.org/records/7443683/files/bias_models.zip?download=1). Use them with
  `-b`, `pred_bw`, `contribs_bw`, `footprints` and so on. The loader replaces the logsumexp `Lambda` layer of
  `chrombpnet.h5` and never runs stored bytecode.
- **Counts-head DeepSHAP needs `chrombpnet_nobias.h5`.** `contribs_bw` refuses the counts head of a full
  `chrombpnet.h5` (1.x or 2.x), because its counts output is a logsumexp of the bias and TF-model heads. Run it
  on `chrombpnet_nobias.h5`, as the pipelines do, or pass `-pc profile`.
- **New models cannot go the other way.** Model files keep their `.h5` names, but Keras 3 writes them.
  TensorFlow 2.x chrombpnet cannot load them, and neither can tools that read the HDF5 weights directly.
- **Contribution-score files keep the 1.x layout**: `/raw/seq`, `/shap/seq`, `/projected_shap/seq`, shape
  (N, 4, L), Blosc-compressed. To read them with h5py, `import hdf5plugin` first.
- **Results match 1.x statistically, not bit for bit.** Initial weights and random streams differ from
  TensorFlow for the same seed. DeepSHAP references, the reads used for Tn5/DNase shift estimation and the
  nonpeak subsample behind the outlier thresholds are now seeded. EarlyStopping restores the best epoch. See the
  [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
